## About

Let’s start with a random but one of my favorite quotes – “Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things. And no good thing ever dies.” – from the movie ‘Shawshank Redemption’. Pretty random, eh? But this quote definitely gets me going even in the worst of times.

Welcome to my webpage! I’m Ajay Kulkarni. I completed my Bachelor of Engineering  in 2013 from Mumbai University and fortunately, a British Investment Bank found me capable enough to work for them.

After working for 2 years, I realized that I want to continue my undergrad research work. I had developed keen interest in Programming Language and Security and I voluntarily took up research projects in my undergrad on these topics. I'm chasing my dream by doing a Master’s degree in Computer Science, specializing in Distributed Systems, Algorithms & Cloud Computing (sidetracked security).
